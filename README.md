## About Me
As a dedicated student at Jurong West Secondary School, I am deeply passionate about programming and problem-solving, aspiring to establish a career in the tech industry. Seeking to enhance my skills, broaden my knowledge, and gather invaluable coding experiences, I am eager to embark on this journey to shape a promising future. My programming journey commenced at the age of 10, back in 2018, when I actively participated in a robotics program facilitated by NLB(National Library Board), where I delved into hands-on projects involving microbits and other small robots. This immersive and engaging experience sparked a profound interest in coding, prompting me to continuously seek avenues to enhance my proficiency. Python stands as my programming language of choice, and for the past 3 years, I have been dedicated to weekly Python classes and ongoing project works. These endeavors have provided me with a solid foundation in Python coding and have equipped me with the capability to tackle complex challenges. Furthermore, I have embraced the opportunity to study Computing as an O-level subject at my school, where Python programming is a key focus. Through this academic pursuit, I am refining my skills and expertise in conceptualizing and executing practical projects that aim to enhance the quality of life. By leveraging Python's versatility and efficiency, I am on a quest to develop innovative solutions that make a positive impact on society. My dedication, perseverance, and continuous learning drive me to push boundaries and explore new horizons in the realm of programming, with the ultimate goal of contributing meaningfully to the community through technology.

## Projects 
### School Management Project
  [Github Link](https://github,com)
  - I have developed software that can read CSV files containing information about students and courses, allowing for data extraction and analysis. The software offers a range of features including calculating the average grade for each course and student, determining the number of students, compiling a list of students who failed a specific course, converting numeric grades to letter grades, counting the occurrences and percentage of each letter grade for a given course, displaying comprehensive data for students based on their first and last names, and assessing the overall grade for students based on their first and last names. These functionalities streamline the process of extracting valuable insights from the data set and provide a robust platform for in-depth analysis and reporting.
